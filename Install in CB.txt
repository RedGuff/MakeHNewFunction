To install this software in Code::Blocks, first download the zip file of the software and unzip in on your SSD (or hard drive).
Then open Code::Blocks and click on the menu "Tools", the "Configure tools", "Add". A folder will appear: choose the ".exe" in the folder you've just unzipped.
Click "Ok", then "Close".
Very important: check it with a dummy "Hello world" function!
Explain me your problems.
Enjoy!

Thanks.
